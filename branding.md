# Branding and Style Guide: OAU Campus Bike Visibility App

## 1. Brand Overview

This section defines the core identity of the OAU Campus Bike Visibility App.

### Mission
To enhance campus-wide visibility for bike transportation within Obafemi Awolowo University, prioritizing user safety and providing real-time location information as a visibility tool, **not** a ride-matching service.

### Vision
To be an indispensable and trusted tool for the OAU community, fostering a safer and more informed campus mobility environment through technology. We aim for seamless integration with campus safety services and, in the future, relevant local businesses.

### Core Values
*   **Safety First**: Prioritizing the well-being of users through clear disclaimers, robust emergency features, and empowering users with information.
*   **Transparency & Clarity**: Providing unambiguous visibility of bike locations and the app's operational purpose. All communication, especially regarding safety and liability, will be direct and easy to understand.
*   **Privacy by Design**: Protecting user data with temporary sessions, minimal data collection, and aggregated analytics, ensuring user anonymity in general usage.
*   **Community Focused**: Dedicated to serving the specific needs and context of the Obafemi Awolowo University campus community.
*   **Accountability & Responsibility**: Empowering users to make informed decisions about their transportation choices while clearly stating the app's role as an information-only tool and the user's responsibility for their own safety.

### Brand Personality
*   **Reliable & Trustworthy**: The app must be perceived as a dependable source of information, especially given its safety components.
*   **Clear & Direct**: Communication is straightforward, unambiguous, and no-nonsense, particularly concerning safety protocols and disclaimers.
*   **Campus-Centric & Supportive**: Approachable and tailored for students and staff, understanding and addressing their specific campus environment.
*   **Cautious & Protective**: While providing a tool, the brand emphasizes user vigilance, responsibility, and the inherent risks of transportation.
*   **Practical & Functional**: Focused on delivering a core utility effectively and efficiently.

## 2. Logo Usage

While a specific logo is not detailed in the PRD, the following guidelines should apply if one is developed:

*   **Simplicity & Clarity**: The logo should be simple, modern, and easily recognizable, even at small app icon sizes.
*   **Relevance**: It should visually suggest the app's core purpose (e.g., elements like a stylized map pin, a subtle bike motif, a shield icon for safety, or abstract representation of visibility/network). Consider OAU's official branding for respectful integration if permissible.
*   **Color**: Logo colors should be derived from the primary brand color palette.
*   **Versatility**: Must work well across different backgrounds and applications (digital, potentially print for awareness campaigns).
*   **Guidelines**: Clear space rules, minimum sizing, and color variations (e.g., full color, monochrome) should be established.
*   **Avoid**: Do not use imagery that implies ride-hailing, transactions, or direct booking.

## 3. Color Palette

The color palette is chosen to evoke trust, safety, and clarity, with strong accents for critical functions.

*   **Primary Colors**:
    *   **Campus Green (e.g., `#2E7D32` - a deep, trustworthy green)**: Represents the campus environment, safety (as in 'go' or safe passage), and can have a grounding, academic feel.
    *   **Safety Blue (e.g., `#0277BD` - a clear, dependable blue)**: Associated with trust, security, and clear communication. Suitable for primary UI elements, information display, and non-urgent calls to action.

*   **Secondary Colors**:
    *   **Caution Amber/Yellow (e.g., `#FF8F00` / `#FFC107`)**: Exclusively for warnings, disclaimers, alerts, and highlighting critical but non-emergency information. Use judiciously to maintain impact.
    *   **Emergency Red (e.g., `#C62828` - a strong, urgent red)**: Strictly for the Panic/Distress button, critical error states, and life-threatening warnings. Demands immediate attention.
    *   **Neutral Grays**:
        *   **Dark Gray (e.g., `#424242`)**: For body text and important secondary information.
        *   **Medium Gray (e.g., `#757575`)**: For less critical text, captions, and disabled states.
        *   **Light Gray (e.g., `#EEEEEE` / `#FAFAFA`)**: For backgrounds, dividers, and UI chrome to ensure content stands out.

*   **Rationale**: This palette balances a sense of calm reliability (Green, Blue) with necessary urgency (Amber, Red) appropriate for an app with significant safety components. Neutrals ensure readability and a clean interface.

## 4. Typography

Typography choices prioritize legibility and clarity, especially for safety-critical information on mobile screens.

*   **Primary Font Family**: A clean, highly legible, and modern sans-serif font.
    *   **Recommended**: **Roboto** or **Open Sans**. These fonts offer a wide range of weights, are optimized for UI, and are readily available.
*   **Usage Guidelines**:
    *   **Headings (H1, H2, H3)**: Primary Font - Bold (e.g., Roboto Bold). Used for screen titles, section headers, and prominent labels.
    *   **Body Text & Disclaimers**: Primary Font - Regular (e.g., Roboto Regular). Must be of adequate size (e.g., 15-17sp/dp for mobile) for easy reading of descriptions, crucial disclaimers, and general content.
    *   **Sub-text & Captions**: Primary Font - Regular or Light (e.g., Roboto Regular or Light). For supplementary information, timestamps, or less critical annotations.
    *   **Button Text**: Primary Font - Medium or Bold (e.g., Roboto Medium). Ensures text on interactive elements is clear and prominent.
    *   **Emphasis**: Use **font weight (bold)** for emphasis. Avoid italics for critical UI text as they can reduce readability. Color can be used for emphasis sparingly and in line with the color palette (e.g., using Caution Amber for a warning phrase).

## 5. Voice & Tone

The app's communication style must be consistent with its core values, especially safety and clarity.

*   **Overall Voice**: Authoritative, clear, helpful, responsible, and direct.
*   **Writing Style**:
    *   **Direct & Concise**: Use short, unambiguous sentences. Get straight to the point, especially in instructions, disclaimers, and safety messages.
    *   **Simple & Accessible Language**: Avoid jargon, overly technical terms, or colloquialisms that might be misunderstood. The target audience (OAU students and staff) is diverse.
    *   **Action-Oriented**: Use active voice where appropriate (e.g., "Activate panic button," "Report bike availability").
*   **Vocabulary**:
    *   Consistently use terms like "visibility," "location information," "safety alert," "caution."
    *   Reinforce key phrases: "**NOT a ride-matching service**," "**Visibility ONLY**," "**Users are 100% responsible for their safety**."
    *   Refer to the app by its official name consistently.
*   **Tone Suggestions**:
    *   **Safety Warnings & Disclaimers**: Serious, firm, unambiguous, and non-negotiable. (e.g., "⚠️ **SAFETY FIRST**: This app provides location visibility ONLY. It is NOT a ride-matching or booking service. Your safety is your responsibility.")
    *   **Emergency Features & Alerts**: Urgent, clear, and reassuring that action is being taken. (e.g., "Panic Alert Activated! Campus Security and your emergency contacts are being notified.")
    *   **Informational Content**: Neutral, helpful, factual, and straightforward. (e.g., "Bike availability near Mozambique Hostel: Medium.")
    *   **General UI & Notifications**: Professional, respectful, and supportive. (e.g., "Welcome to the OAU Campus Bike Visibility App. Please review the safety guidelines before proceeding.")

## 6. Imagery Style

Imagery should be functional, clear, and support the app's purpose without causing misinterpretation.

*   **Icons**:
    *   **Style**: Flat design, Material Design icons, or a similar clean, universally understandable icon style. Ensure consistency across all icons.
    *   **Function**: Icons should clearly communicate their purpose (e.g., map pin for location, shield for safety, bell for alerts, user silhouette for roles, gear for settings).
    *   **Color**: Use primary or secondary colors. Emergency-related icons (Panic Button) must use Emergency Red. Warning icons can use Caution Amber.
*   **Illustrations**:
    *   **Usage**: Sparingly, perhaps for onboarding screens, empty states, or educational material about safety.
    *   **Style**: Simple, clean, and abstract or stylized. Could depict generic campus scenes or map elements.
    *   **Avoid**: Illustrations that show transactions, people hailing bikes *through the app*, or any imagery that implies ride-booking or guaranteed safety by the app.
*   **Photography**:
    *   **In-App**: Generally avoid photography within the app UI to keep it functional and lightweight.
    *   **Promotional Materials (if any)**:
        *   Focus on the OAU campus environment (well-lit, recognizable, safe-looking areas).
        *   Can show students using their phones in a campus setting, but **not** in a way that suggests the app is used for booking or hailing rides.
        *   Tone: Authentic, safe, community-oriented, positive.
*   **Maps**:
    *   The map interface is a core visual. Use clear, uncluttered map styles (e.g., default styles from Google Maps, Mapbox, or Leaflet with customization for clarity).
    *   OAU boundaries, defined zones, and key campus landmarks must be clearly and accurately visualized. Use distinct markers.

## 7. UI Style Principles

User Interface (UI) design must prioritize ease of use, clarity, and immediate access to safety features.

*   **Clarity & Readability**:
    *   High contrast between text and backgrounds.
    *   Ample font sizes, especially for disclaimers and critical information.
    *   Generous spacing and padding around elements to reduce clutter and improve scannability.
*   **Prominent Safety Features**:
    *   **Emergency/Panic Button**: Must be **always visible** or exceptionally easy to access (e.g., persistent footer/header, prominent Floating Action Button). It should use the **Emergency Red** color and a clear, universally recognized icon (e.g., SOS, exclamation mark in a triangle).
    *   **Disclaimers**: Displayed prominently and unmissably **on every app launch** as per PRD. Use clear typography, potentially with a Caution Amber icon or header to draw attention. Users must acknowledge these before proceeding.
*   **Button Styles**:
    *   **Primary Actions**: Clear visual hierarchy. Solid fill, rounded corners, distinct text (e.g., "Show Bikes," "Report My Location"). Use a primary color (e.g., Safety Blue or Campus Green).
    *   **Secondary Actions**: Outlined style or a lighter shade of a primary color.
    *   **Emergency Button**: Unique, highly visible style (see above).
*   **Information Hierarchy**:
    *   Use typography (size, weight), color, and layout to guide the user's attention to the most important information first.
    *   Bike availability status should be easily digestible at a glance (e.g., color-coded text/icons: Green for High, Amber for Medium, Red for Low/None).
*   **Role Toggle (Driver/Passenger)**: Clear, intuitive, and visually distinct selection state.
*   **Map Interface**:
    *   Intuitive zoom and pan controls.
    *   Clear, distinguishable markers for OAU locations, common pickup spots, and reported bike locations.
    *   Geofenced OAU campus area should be visually well-defined.
*   **Feedback & Confirmation**: Provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., successful report, panic button activation sequence).
*   **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent design language (colors, fonts, spacing, component styles) across all screens and interactions.

## 8. Do’s and Don’ts

Key principles to ensure brand integrity and user understanding:

### Do’s:
*   **DO** prominently display full safety disclaimers on **every app launch** and require acknowledgment.
*   **DO** use clear, direct, and simple language, especially for all safety information, disclaimers, and instructions.
*   **DO** make the Emergency/Panic button exceptionally visible, easily accessible, and use the designated Emergency Red color.
*   **DO** consistently reinforce that the app provides "visibility ONLY" and is "**NOT** a ride-matching or booking service."
*   **DO** use the defined color palette to build trust and clearly highlight warnings and emergencies.
*   **DO** ensure all text is highly legible with sufficient size and contrast.
*   **DO** champion user privacy in all design and communication, adhering to the "Privacy-First Design" principles.
*   **DO** incorporate OAU-specific landmarks and terminology where appropriate to enhance relevance and community connection.
*   **DO** maintain a clean, uncluttered, and intuitive user interface focused on core functionality.
*   **DO** clearly state that users are 100% responsible for their safety and decisions.

### Don’ts:
*   **DON'T** use any language, imagery, or UI elements that could imply ride booking, hailing, payment for rides, or driver-passenger matching.
*   **DON'T** hide, minimize, or allow users to easily bypass safety disclaimers or liability information.
*   **DON'T** collect or store any personal user data beyond what is absolutely essential for a temporary session and explicitly outlined in the privacy policy (e.g., no persistent user accounts beyond session data).
*   **DON'T** use a playful, casual, or ambiguous tone for safety-critical messages or app functionality.
*   **DON'T** clutter the interface with non-essential features, especially those that could distract from safety or core visibility functions.
*   **DON'T** use colors or typography in a way that hinders readability, causes eye strain, or misrepresents the severity of information.
*   **DON'T** imply or state that the app guarantees user safety; it is a tool to provide information and emergency assistance features.
*   **DON'T** make the Emergency/Panic button difficult to find, activate, or require multiple complex steps to trigger.
*   **DON'T** refer to bike providers as "drivers" in a commercial service sense; use neutral terms like "bike operators," "individuals sharing location," or simply "bikes visible on map." (The PRD uses "Driver/Passenger" for roles, which is acceptable for role selection, but broader communication should be careful).
